🚀 About Me

I am an Avionics Technician and an aspiring Informatics Engineer currently studying at Universidad de Buenos Aires. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and aviation, and I thrive on solving challenges that push the boundaries of both fields.

🛠️ What I Do

- Electronics & Embedded Systems: Working with sensors (e.g., DS18B20), microcontrollers (RP2040 Zero, ESP32), and hardware (EL817 optocoupler).
- Software Development: Exploring Python, MicroPython, FreeRTOS, and TensorFlow for real-world applications.
- Avionics Systems: Delving into signal processing, RF connectors, and aeronautical wiring harnesses.
- AI & Machine Learning: Extracting EEG signal features and training models for brainwave-to-command mapping.
