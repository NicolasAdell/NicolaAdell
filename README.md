- Software Development: Exploring Python, MicroPython, FreeRTOS, and TensorFlow for real-world applications.
- Avionics Systems: Delving into signal processing, RF connectors, and aeronautical wiring harnesses.
- AI & Machine Learning: Extracting EEG signal features and training models for brainwave-to-command mapping.

🎯 Goals

- Build innovative systems integrating hardware and software.
- Contribute to impactful open-source projects in robotics and assistive technology.
- Continue advancing technical expertise in embedded systems and control systems.
